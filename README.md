# Morpho Token

Morpho's token contract based on the [semitransferable token](https://github.com/mangrovedao/semitransferable-token) build by Mangrove DAO.

At deployment, 1B tokens will be minted by the owner (the Morpho DAO).
The token will, first, be a non-transferable token and then become fully transferable.
Token owners can burn their own tokens at any time.
